The repository includes the description of my region of interest through the exploration in Github. 



## tensorflow-deeplab-dynamic-segmentation

The project includes the implementation of a dynamic segmentation network on Tensorflow, and could be quite charming to me. 

The procedure mainly includes:

- Data Preprocessing
- Running the train/eval/vis jobs
- local visualization job using `xception_65`
